It's a new year and time to start some new things. This is a personal website I'm creating using Zola since it is written in Rust and I like Rust. I'm a geek that way. You'll get used to it. 

In spite of being on various social media sites, I've never gotten into posting much there. But maybe this will work for me. I've certainly got a lot of things to say.
